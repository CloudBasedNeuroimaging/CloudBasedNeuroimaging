We are seeking feedback on a user's guide developed by a working group convened under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders on issues to be considered when deciding whether to use cloud-based resources for neuroimaging research (or other types of research), as well as resources and best practice suggestions.

Please feel free to leave your comments as issues, or to submit pull requests with suggested changes.

In addition, please consider completing this [online feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScinAtJDAdMqST2hAjMZTD9uPjw-g6eaSzFCaZ71oWes43W6Q/viewform).
